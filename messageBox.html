      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Listen, I know its hard to deal with life sometimes <br />
        and people around us act shit sometimes which can totally ruin our day
        <br />
        but I believe that we should never let our emotions get affected for
        other peoples sake <br />
        when we know they arent even trying to make it better, infact they are
        trying the opposite. <br />
        <br />
        well..in that case, how about we see the beauty in ourself and keep
        going? its okay they hate us, <br />
        but does that mean we should be sad and depressed? no.. they dont wanna
        fw us then we find ppl <br />
        who wants to fw with us, its okay princess, you will find manyyyyy ppl
        who will treat you better <br />
        dont feel bad just coz ONE of them treats you bad. hope you have an
        amazing day when you read this. <br />
        as always, lee wishes you the best for your future. ðŸ˜›
